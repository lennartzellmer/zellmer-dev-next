## I’m Lennart — Senior Product Manager, proud dad of three, tech enthusiast, and Master of Science.

I’ve had the pleasure of working across [Friedrichshafen]{style="text-decoration: line-through;"} / [Berlin]{style="text-decoration: line-through;"} / [Copenhagen]{style="text-decoration: line-through;"} / [Marburg]{style="text-decoration: line-through;"} / Bonn and remotely, collaborating with talented teams around Europe. As a Senior Product Manager at elvah, a company specializing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, I’m driven to set ambitious goals and empower my team to achieve them. At elvah, we’re pushing the boundaries of what’s possible by leveraging data to boost infrastructure profitability and elevate user experiences.

My background in online shopping and e-commerce has honed my expertise in building highly customized apps, with a strong focus on conversion flows and data-driven measurability to drive user engagement and retention.

I hold an MSc in Business Administration and E-business from Zeppelin University and Copenhagen Business School. Since 2016, I’ve been shaping user experiences at elvah (formerly kreait), where we’re pushing the boundaries of the e-mobility industry. My team is dedicated to refining app and web payment flows while maintaining a conversion-focused data stack.

As a product enthusiast at heart, I often find myself diving into web development, design or state machines —it’s simply too much fun to resist!
